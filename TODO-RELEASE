libosmogsm  new header osmocom/gsm/protocol/gsm_44_060.h
libosmocore ADD     new defines in osmocom/gsm/protocol/gsm_04_08.h (old ones marked deprecated)
core		log_target.print_timestamp	Flag replaced by log_target.timestamp_format.
		log_target.print_ext_timestamp	Flag replaced by log_target.timestamp_format.

core		log_set_print_timestamp()	Replaced by log_set_print_timestamp2().
core		log_set_print_extended_timestamp()	Replaced by log_set_print_timestamp2().
						Since the 'print timestamp' settings are now stored as a single enum,
						the behavior of calling log_set_print_timestamp(0) and
						log_set_print_extended_timestamp(0) changes: when calling with zero
						argument, logging now always snaps back to LOG_TIMSTAMP_NONE, instead of
						maybe going to LOG_TIMSTAMP_CTIME, depending on what flags were
						otherwise set.
vty logging	'logging timestamp (0|1)'	deprecated, replaced by 'logging print timestamp (none|ctime)'
vty logging	'logging print extended-timestamp (0|1)'	deprecated, replaced by 'logging print timestamp (none|date-packed)'
